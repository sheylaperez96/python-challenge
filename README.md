# Unit 3 Homework: Python
This assignment consists of two challenges: PyBank & PyPoll
- **PyBank**: Help analyze the financial records of a company
- **PyPoll**: Help a small rural town to modernize its vote counting process

## PyBank Challenge

### Background 
Inside the PyBank > Resources folder, there's a "budget_data.csv" file that contains two columns ("Date" and "Profit/Losses")

I created a python script to calculate the following metrics using budget_data.csv:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The final script (main.py) can be found in the PyBank folder. My final script is also exported to a text file. The text file is located in the PyBank > analysis folder.

### Results
Below are the results for the PyBank Challenge:
- Total Months: 86
- Total: $22564198
- Average Change: $-8311.11
- Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
- Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)

## PyPoll Challenge

### Background 
Inside the PyPoll > Resources folder, there's a "election_data.csv" file that contains three columns ("Ballot ID", "County", and "Candidate")

I created a python script to calculate the following metrics using election_data.csv:
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote.

The final script (main.py) can be found in the PyPoll folder. My final script is also exported to a text file. The text file is located in the PyPoll > analysis folder.

### Results
Below are the results for the PyPoll Challenge:
- Total Votes: 369711
- Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)
- Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
- Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
- Winner: Diana DeGette
