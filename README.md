# Unit 3 Homework: Python
This assignment consists of two challenges: PyBank & PyPoll
- **PyBank**: Help analyze the financial records of a company
- **PyPoll**: Help a small rural town to modernize its vote counting process.

## PyBank Challenge

### Background 
Inside the PyBank > Resources folder, there's a "budget_data.csv" file that contains two columns ("Date" and "Profit/Losses")

I created a python script to calculate the following metrics using budget_data.csv:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The final script (main.py) can be found in the PyBank folder. My final script is also exported to a text file with the results. The text file is located in the PyBank > analysis folder.

### Results
Below are the results for the PyBank Challenge:
- Total Months: 86
- Total: $22564198
- Average Change: $-8311.11
- Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
- Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)
